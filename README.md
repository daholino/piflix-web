# Piflix Web üé• üçø

This project represents a client for [Piflix](https://github.com/daholino/piflix) and is embedded inside it. It is based on React and you need to have `npm` installed to run it.

This project is embedded inside the Piflix binary but you can still run it independently on a different port.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
